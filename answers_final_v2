5. How much money have the suppliers made? Given that some items
are produced by multiple suppliers, and because of our
database design we don’t know who supplied the particular item
on an order - what are the maximum possible earnings of each
supplier?

SELECT s.supplierID, SUM( i.unitcost * i.stocklevel ) AS maxearnings
FROM supplieritems AS s
INNER JOIN items AS i ON i.itemID = s.itemID
GROUP BY s.supplierID

supplierID maxearnings

S3    198.00

6. What are the names and total spend of customers who made more

INNER JOIN lineitems AS li ON li.orderID = o.orderID
INNER JOIN items AS i ON i.itemID = li.itemID
